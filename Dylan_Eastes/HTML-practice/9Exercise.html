    <h1>The Scents of Men and Women</h1>
    <p>
      The body odors of men and women smell different.<br>
      The natural scent of women's body odor is similar to onions and grapefruit.<br>
      The natural scent of men's body odor is more like rotten cheese.<br>
      Women wear sweet purfume because it's close to their natural scents,<br>
      whereas men wear muskier scents because they're closer to their natural odors.
